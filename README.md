# Remote-Controlled-Car-using-ESP8266-NodeMCU-built-in-wifi
In this project, I crafted a remote-controlled car using ESP8266 as the central processing unit, transmitting the signal using built-in wifi module of ESP8266, L298 to control the car's wheels motor and use 3 4V cell battery to provide the power for the whole system.
